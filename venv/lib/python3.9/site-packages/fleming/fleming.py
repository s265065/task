    """
    Floors a datetime to the nearest time boundary.

    Perform a floor on a datetime, rounding the datetime to its nearest provided interval.
    Available intervals are year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.

    For example, to round to the nearest month, provide month=1 as input. Give a value
    like 3 to the month argument and it will round to the nearest trimonth in a year
    (i.e. the nearest quarter). Values for other intervals operate in the same way, such
    as rounding down to the nearest day in a month (or nearest triday).

    The only paramter to this function which is not like the others is the week parameter.
    The week parameter rounds the time down to its nearest Monday. In contrast to other
    intervals, week can only be 1 since it has no larger time interval from which to
    start a tri or quadweek for example.

    Also, if the week parameter is provided, the year and month arguments are also
    not used in the floor calculation.

    Note that multiple combinations of attributes can be used where they make sense,
    such as flooring to the nearest trimonth and triday (month=3, day=3).

    :type within_tz: pytz timezone
    :param within_tz: A pytz timezone object. If given, the floor will
        be performed with respect to the timezone.

    :type year: int
    :param year: Specifies the yearly interval to round down to. Defaults to None.

    :type month: int
    :param month: Specifies the monthly interval (inside of a year) to round
        down to. Defaults to None.

    :type week: int
    :param week: Specifies to round to the beginning of the previous week.
        Defaults to None and only accepts a possible value of 1.

    :type day: int
    :param day: Specifies the daily interval to round down to (inside of a
        month). Defaults to None.

    :type hour: int
    :param hour: Specifies the hourly interval to round down to (inside of a
        day). Defaults to None.

    :type minute: int
    :param minute: Specifies the minute interval to round down to (inside of an
        hour). Defaults to None.

    :type second: int
    :param second: Specifies the second interval to round down to (inside of a
        minute). Defaults to None.

    :type microsecond: int
    :param microsecond: Specifies the microsecond interval to round down to
        (inside of a second). Defaults to None.

    :type extra_td_if_floor: timedelta
    :param extra_td_if_floor: Only used by the ceil function. Specifies an
        extra timedelta to be added to the result if a floor has occurred.

    :returns: A datetime object that results from flooring dt to the interval.
        The timezone of the returned datetime will be equivalent to the
        original timezone of dt (or its DST equivalent if a DST border was
        crossed). If the input time was naive, it returns a naive datetime
        object.

        Defaults to None and only accepts a possible value of 1.

    :type day: int
